            This website is the home page of polycenter.space. In addition to hosting online services I also
            use this website as a coding sandbox to showcase and practice development skills. Part of the
            learning process is to collaborate with others. Donâ€™t hesitate to send a message in the{" "}
            <Link href="/contact">Contact Page</Link> or use it as a tool to report a bug you find.
