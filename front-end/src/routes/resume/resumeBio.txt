I am a software engineer from the greater Seattle area. My high school passion for programming lead to graduate from DePauw University with a computer science degree. In addition to working in Seattle programming continues to stay my passion. Teaching others is an important part of software development as it helps look at problems from different perspectives, while having an open mind to learning not only increases tech skills but also exercises the brain.
